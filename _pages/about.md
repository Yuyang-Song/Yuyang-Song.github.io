<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Yuyang Song is an undergraduate student majoring in computer science of Wuyuzhang Honour College in Sichuan University, expected to graduate in June 2026 under the supervision of Prof.[Mingjie tang](https://merlintang.github.io/), [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/) and Prof.[Jianguo Wang](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/csjgwang/), [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). 
Currently, his research interest lies in efficient reasoning LLMs, particularly LLM based Database System Design and Optimization.

 
> I am eager to pursue admission to a PhD program in Fall 2026 to deepen my expertise and make meaningful contributions.

<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
We introduce IQuest-Coder-V1, a high-performance code LLM that achieves leading results on multiple public benchmarks, surpassing several competitive closed-source models.
I mainly contributed to the post-training design and optimization, with a particular emphasis on Text-to-SQL reasoning (BIRD, Spider) and terminal-level execution tasks (Terminal-Bench-v1.0), substantially improving the model’s practical reasoning and action fidelity, surpassing the cutting-edge LLMs.

<!-- [**Code**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC)  -->

<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
QUITE is a training-free and feedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a broader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based methods.
