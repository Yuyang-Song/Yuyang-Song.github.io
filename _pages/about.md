#  Projects
<!-- ### Query Rewrite via Large Language Model for DBMS | 2024.07 - 2024.08
- Leverage the analytical power of Large Language Model to propose the relational rules of SQL optimization.
- Repeat a LLM-based optimization pipline to reduce the hallucination issues in Large Language Model.
- Construct a rewrite rule knowledge pool to further gain the learn ability.
